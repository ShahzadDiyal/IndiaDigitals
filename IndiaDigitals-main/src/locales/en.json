            "question": "How does custom software development differ from off-the-shelf software?",
            "answer": "Custom software development is designed to meet the needs of a particular user or business, while off-the-shelf software is developed for a broader audience. One of the main advantages of custom solutions is that they are flexible and can fit in with a company's other systems and software, while off-the-shelf solutions are less flexible and not designed with the business in mind."

        "faq2": {
            "question": "What are the benefits of developing custom software?",
            "answer": "There are many benefits to developing custom software, including personalization, efficiency, and scalability.
